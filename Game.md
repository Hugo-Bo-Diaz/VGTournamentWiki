<h2>The Objective</h2>
<p>
Explain that you need to survive 4 days to win and that no money = lose
</p>
<h2>Employees</h2>
<p>
For this event to be succesful you're going to need the right amount of staff, there are two types of employees:
	<ul>
		<li>Organizers: They'll be calling the players to the setups so that the matches can start playing, if they work too much they can get exhausted, make sure they stay healthy!</li>
		<li>Technicians: Whenever you need to install something or repairs they will come out of the room to make sure that it gets done as soon as possible</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<h2>Machinery(part of technician?)</h2>
<p>
explain trash, setups and vending machines
</p>
<h2>Participants</h2>
<p>
The most important people in the event are these guys, they have the money you need to keep the event running and you have to make them spend it!
</p>
<p>
The more you have the higher tier your tournament will be, from C all the way to the coveted SS tier, when the tournament reaches maximum capacity
</p>
<p>
Make sure that your participants are happy or they may leave!, they'll be happier the more they win and the more they drink from the vending machines. If a setup breaks while they are playing, if there is not enough space on the trash or even if they lose too much they will be angrier everytime, until they leave.
