<h2><u>About me</u></h2>

	<p>
	I'm a student from Barcelona from the UPC that also likes to take part on the esports community, particularly on the fighting game genre. My experiences there were my inspiration when choosing the theme of this game and its gameplay mechanics. I started my game development journey when I was around 11 years old with GameMaker 8.0 and have been enjoying coding since, although this project was made on unity and I prefer coding on C++.
